## Project Vision

After trying a few different technologies during my last project [treban](https://github.com/Afanami/treban) I wanted to dive deeper into learning more about some of the technologies I used. So for this project I'm abstracting away from all the backend layer with GraphQL, Prisma and PostgreSQL and using Sanity as the CMS so I can purely focus on achieving a deeper understanding of TypeScript & Next.js. The overall project vision is just to increase my experience with these technologies and get a better feel for them by having a clear idea of what I'm going to build.

## Project Progress

Setup Next.js template and updated README file with project information. Created some base components and added tailwind styled components for component styling. Refactoring current tailwind styles into styled components. Created video component and got videos rendering and pausing/playing. Need to tidy up styles into styled components for video component later.
