## Project Vision

After trying a few different technologies during my last project [treban](https://github.com/Afanami/treban) I wanted to dive deeper into learning more about some of the technologies I used. So for this project I'm abstracting away from all the backend layer with GraphQL, Prisma and PostgreSQL and using Sanity as the CMS so I can purely focus on achieving a deeper understanding of TypeScript & Next.js. The overall project vision is just to increase my experience with these technologies and get a better feel for them by having a clear idea of what I'm going to build.

## Project Progress

Setup Next.js template and updated README file with project information.
